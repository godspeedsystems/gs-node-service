# A note on components

# Components
# We use components like open api spec, to define the reusable components across the following categories
# These components are aimed to be reused across events, functions, datasources.
# For examples, schemas, responses, examples, parameters, requestBodies, headers, events, functions, datasources. There could be more types of components as per developer need, for any reusable piece of YAML
# ANY YAML file can have a components key. One can create and reference components in the same file or across files.
# https://davidgarcia.dev/posts/how-to-split-open-api-spec-into-multiple-files/
# One can use . .. # as per conventional usage.
